1) introduced everyone and state what api we used.
    -we needed to get an api key inorder to to any api calls
    -stored all the info in the config.json as requiered 
    -useded 4 different search calls, multi/person/movie/tv
2) angi will talk about cli 
    -multi search is our defult search where no option is given
    - we use option for our person search -p to search the api witch calls search/person 
    folled by quary string
    -same for the rest: tv,and movie
    -checks for invalid intries

3) specify more on the search
    -used inquiere to print the choices of each name and return an object of id and media_type app.js line 42 and 48
    in line 42 we make a new list of object containing name and value. in the inquiere doc name will use to display the list 
    and value will be the return after user clicks. we need to know the media_type in order to find where the id belong
    - made sure if theres no results to dont prompt the user to choose from nothing but instad print an message

4) search by id
    - getting the search id and medi type (tv, person,movie) we make another api call with the url of /mediatype/id?key=...
    line 42 in moviedb.js thats the format what the api calls for
    - use the type list so user can use arrow keys to choose
    - after geting the results we needed to find what is usefull for us so for person we used dob, place of birth. n bio n media type
    n for tv and movie we used name, media type, released date, n overview
5)print-
    -takes the object that is inputted with the information
        -tv: name, type, release date, and overview
        -movie: name, type, release date, and overview
        -person: name, birthday, place of birth, biography
    -print-message
        -red: tv
        -blue: movie
        -green: person
    -wordwrap
        -100 characters, since it would overflow
